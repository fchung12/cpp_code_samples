When building the original unmodified HW1.zip project I ran into this error in Visual Studio 2019 community:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43141401/visual-studio-error-d8016-zi-and-gy-command-line-options-are-incompatible
This was fixed by changing the Gy- flag to Gy mentioned in the stack overflow page.
